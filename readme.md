# Title: Github Repo Search Tool

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description

The Github Repo Search Tool provides enhanced search functionality, allowing users to find repositories based on topics, ratings, and programming languages.

## Features

1. Search by Topic: The Github Repo Search Tool allows users to search for repositories based on specific topics. Users can enter a topic of interest, and the tool will retrieve repositories related to that topic.

2. Search by Top Rated: Users can search for repositories based on their rating or popularity. By specifying a minimum rating threshold, the tool fetches repositories that meet or exceed the specified rating.

3. Search by Language: The tool enables users to search for repositories written in specific programming languages. Users can select a programming language from the available options, and the tool will fetch repositories written in the chosen language.

4. Sorting by Top Rated: The search results can be sorted by the rating or popularity of the repositories. This feature allows users to view the repositories in descending order of their ratings, helping them identify the most highly rated repositories.
